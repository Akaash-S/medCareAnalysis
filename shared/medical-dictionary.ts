  "cholesterol": {
    term: "cholesterol",
    simplified: "fat-like substance in blood",
    definition: "A waxy, fat-like substance found in all cells of the body. Your body needs some cholesterol to make hormones, vitamin D, and substances that help you digest foods. High cholesterol can lead to heart disease."
  },
  "elevated cholesterol levels": {
    term: "elevated cholesterol levels",
    simplified: "high cholesterol",
    definition: "When the amount of cholesterol in your blood is higher than recommended, increasing the risk of heart disease and stroke."
  },
  "LDL": {
    term: "LDL (Low-Density Lipoprotein)",
    simplified: "\"Bad\" cholesterol (LDL)",
    definition: "Often called \"bad\" cholesterol, LDL can build up in your arteries and form plaque that makes them narrower. Higher levels mean higher risk of heart disease.",
    normalRange: "< 100 mg/dL (optimal)"
  },
  "HDL": {
    term: "HDL (High-Density Lipoprotein)",
    simplified: "\"Good\" cholesterol (HDL)",
    definition: "Known as \"good\" cholesterol, HDL helps remove other forms of cholesterol from your bloodstream. Higher levels are better and may lower your risk of heart disease.",

  },
  "triglycerides": {
    term: "Triglycerides",
    simplified: "Blood fats (Triglycerides)",
    definition: "A type of fat found in your blood. When you eat, your body converts calories it doesn't need into triglycerides, which are stored in fat cells. High levels may contribute to hardening of the arteries and increased risk of heart disease.",
    normalRange: "< 150 mg/dL"
  },
  "atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease": {
    term: "atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease",
    simplified: "heart disease caused by plaque buildup in arteries",
    definition: "A condition where plaque builds up inside the arteries. Plaque is made up of fat, cholesterol, calcium, and other substances. Over time, plaque hardens and narrows the arteries, limiting blood flow to organs and other parts of the body."
  },
  "statin therapy": {
    term: "statin therapy",
    simplified: "cholesterol-lowering medication",
    definition: "Medications that help lower cholesterol levels in the blood by reducing the amount of cholesterol produced by the liver."

  },
  "hypertension": {
    term: "hypertension",
    simplified: "high blood pressure",
    definition: "A condition in which the force of the blood against the artery walls is too high. Normal blood pressure is below 120/80 mm Hg."
  },
  "glucose": {
    term: "glucose",
    simplified: "blood sugar",
    definition: "A simple sugar that is an important energy source in living organisms and is a component of many carbohydrates."
  },
  "HbA1c": {
    term: "HbA1c",
    simplified: "average blood sugar level",
    definition: "A test that measures your average blood sugar levels over the past 2-3 months. It's used to diagnose diabetes and monitor how well diabetes is being controlled.",

  },
  "creatinine": {
    term: "creatinine",

    normalRange: "0.7-1.3 mg/dL (men), 0.6-1.1 mg/dL (women)"
  },
  "thyroid-stimulating hormone": {
    term: "thyroid-stimulating hormone",
    simplified: "hormone that controls thyroid function",
    definition: "A hormone produced by the pituitary gland that regulates the production of hormones by the thyroid gland.",
    normalRange: "0.4-4.0 mIU/L"
  },
  "anemia": {
    term: "anemia",
    simplified: "low red blood cell count",

  },
  "hemoglobin": {
    term: "hemoglobin",
